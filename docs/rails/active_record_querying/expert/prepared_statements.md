## ðŸš€ Leverage Prepared Statements for Repeated Queries
Rails automatically caches prepared statements, but you can manually manage them for highly repetitive queries to shave off planning time. Use `connection.prepare` and `connection.exec_prepared` when you need fine-grained control over statement reuse and parameter binding.

```ruby
conn = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection
conn.prepare('find_user_by_email', 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1')
result = conn.exec_prepared('find_user_by_email', ['bob@example.com'])
``` 

This low-level approach reduces round-trip overhead and can significantly speed up tight loops of similar queries.
