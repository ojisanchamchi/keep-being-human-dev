## ðŸš€ Engine-Isolated Layouts
When building Rails Engines, isolate layouts inside the engine to prevent collisions and allow host apps to override. Use `isolate_namespace` and set `layout` within the engine's base controller.

```ruby
module BlogEngine
  class Engine < ::Rails::Engine
    isolate_namespace BlogEngine
  end

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    layout 'blog_engine/application'
  end
end
```

Place your engine layouts in `app/views/layouts/blog_engine/application.html.erb`. The host app can override by creating a same-named file in its `app/views/layouts/blog_engine` directory, promoting clear boundaries.
