## ðŸŽ¯ Eigenclass for perâ€‘object metaprogramming
Open an objectâ€™s singleton class to add methods specific to that instance, giving you fineâ€‘grained control over behavior without affecting other instances.

```ruby
user = User.new
class << user
  def greet
    "Hello, #{name}!"
  end
end

user.greet # => "Hello, Alice!"
```
