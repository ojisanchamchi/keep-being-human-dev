## ðŸ”„ Use Multiple Assignment for Conciseness

Ruby lets you assign multiple variables in a single line, making your code shorter and cleaner. This is especially useful when you want to swap values or unpack arrays.

```ruby
# assign multiple values
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3

# swap variables without a temp
a, b = b, a
```
