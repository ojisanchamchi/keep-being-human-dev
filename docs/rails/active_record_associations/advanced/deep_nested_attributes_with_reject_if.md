## 🏗 Deep Nested Attributes with Conditional Rejection
Control mass-assignment for deeply nested associations by using `accepts_nested_attributes_for` with a `reject_if` proc. This ensures only valid nested records are built or updated, preventing orphan or blank entries.

```ruby
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :milestones
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :milestones,
                                allow_destroy: true,
                                reject_if: ->(attrs) { attrs['name'].blank? }
end

# In controller
def project_params
  params.require(:project).permit(:title,
    milestones_attributes: [:id, :name, :due_date, :_destroy])
end
```
