## ðŸ”¢ Numbers and Basic Arithmetic

Ruby provides Integer and Float types for numeric operations. Integers are whole numbers, while Floats represent decimal values. You can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly.

```ruby
# Integer operations
sum = 2 + 3
difference = 5 - 1

# Float operations
average = 4.0 / 2.0
product = 2 * 3.5
puts sum, difference, average, product
```
