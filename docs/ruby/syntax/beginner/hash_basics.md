## ðŸ”§ Hash Basics
Hashes map unique keys to values and are defined with curly braces. Keys can be symbols or strings, and you access values using bracket notation. They are handy for grouping related data.

```ruby
person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }
puts person[:name]  # => "Alice"
person[:city] = "London"
```
