## ðŸŽ² Exponentiation Operator
Ruby's `**` operator performs exponentiation, replacing calls to `Math.pow`. It's useful for mathematical computations directly in expressions.

```ruby
2 ** 3    # => 8
9 ** 0.5  # => 3.0   # square root
# Combine with other operators
3 * 2**4  # => 48    # equivalent to 3 * (2**4)
```
