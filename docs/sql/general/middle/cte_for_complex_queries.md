## ðŸ”— Use CTEs to Simplify Complex Queries
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) help break down complex SQL logic into manageable parts, improving readability and maintainability. Use `WITH` clauses to define intermediate result sets and reference them in your main query.

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT seller_id, SUM(amount) AS total
  FROM sales
  WHERE sale_date >= '2023-01-01'
  GROUP BY seller_id
)
SELECT s.name, m.total
FROM sellers s
JOIN monthly_sales m ON s.id = m.seller_id
ORDER BY m.total DESC;
```
