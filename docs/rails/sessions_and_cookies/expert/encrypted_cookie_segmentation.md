## ðŸ”‘ Advanced Encrypted Cookie Segmentation

When you need to store small, nonâ€‘sensitive data alongside your main session without inflating the session payload, you can leverage Railsâ€™ `encrypted_cookie` jar in parallel to your serverâ€‘side session store. This keeps the main session lean (in Redis or DB) while enabling tamperâ€‘proof clientâ€‘side storage for flags or feature toggles.

1. Configure an additional encrypted cookie in `application_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :load_feature_flags

  private

  def feature_flags
    cookies.encrypted[:feature_flags] ||= {}
  end

  def load_feature_flags
    @feature_flags = feature_flags
  end
end
```

2. Write to the encrypted cookie without hitting your DB:

```ruby
# In any controller or service
current_flags = cookies.encrypted[:feature_flags] || {}
current_flags[:beta_ui] = true
cookies.encrypted[:feature_flags] = {
  value: current_flags,
  expires: 1.week.from_now,
  secure: Rails.env.production?,
  same_site: :lax
}
```

3. This pattern isolates ephemeral toggles in the client, avoids session bloat in Redis/DB, and ensures confidentiality and integrity via encryption.
