## ✏️ Writing Multi-line Code

When defining methods or writing longer blocks, IRB automatically enters multi-line mode after a code delimiter. You can also use a backslash `\` to continue a line:

```ruby
irb(main):001:0> long_string = "This is a \
irb-friendly multi-line string"
```

Press Enter on an empty line to execute the whole block.
