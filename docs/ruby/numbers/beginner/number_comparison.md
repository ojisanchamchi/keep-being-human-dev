## 🔍 Comparing Numbers

Use comparison operators to compare numeric values: greater than (`>`), less than (`<`), equal (`==`), not equal (`!=`), and the spaceship operator (`<=>`) which returns `-1`, `0`, or `1`.

```ruby
a = 5
b = 8

puts a > b     # => false
puts a < b     # => true
puts a == b    # => false
puts a != b    # => true
puts a <=> b   # => -1       # a is less than b
```
