## üõ†Ô∏è Install and Configure Sidekiq

Sidekiq is a popular background job processor that integrates seamlessly with Rails. Add the gem and configure Rails to use Sidekiq as the Active Job adapter so all your jobs run through it.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'sidekiq'
```

```bash
# then install
bundle install
```

In `config/application.rb` or in your specific environment config (`config/environments/development.rb`):

```ruby
# config/application.rb
module YourApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Use Sidekiq for background jobs
    config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
  end
end
```

Make sure to start a Redis server and then launch Sidekiq with:

```bash
bundle exec sidekiq
```
