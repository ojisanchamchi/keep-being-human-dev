## ðŸŽ¯ Defining and Accessing Constants

Constants in Ruby are used to store values that shouldnâ€™t change at runtime, like configuration values or fixed thresholds. You can define them at the top level or inside classes and modules, then reference them directly by name.

```ruby
# Top-level constant
timeout_seconds = 5
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 5

# Inside a class
class ApiClient
  MAX_RETRIES = 3

  def fetch
    retries = 0
    while retries < MAX_RETRIES
      # perform request
      retries += 1
    end
  end
end

puts DEFAULT_TIMEOUT       # => 5
puts ApiClient::MAX_RETRIES  # => 3
```
