## ðŸ“Œ Choose Clear Variable Names

Naming variables clearly helps make your code readable. In Ruby, variable names should start with a lowercase letter or underscore, and use snake_case. Avoid single-letter names except for counters or loops.

```ruby
# bad
x = 10
# better
student_age = 10

# using underscores to separate words
first_name = "Alice"
```
