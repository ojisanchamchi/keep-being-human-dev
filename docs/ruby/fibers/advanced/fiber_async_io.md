## ðŸš€ Concurrent IO Without Threads Using Fibers
Leverage `IO.select` inside fibers to multiplex socket or file IO, achieving nonâ€‘blocking behavior without spawning OS threads. By resuming fibers when their IO is readable or writable, you can manage thousands of connections in a single reactor loop.

```ruby
clients = []
server = TCPServer.new(1234)

def handle(client)
  loop do
    data = client.read_nonblock(1024)
    break if data.empty?
    client.write "Echo: #{data}"
  end
rescue IO::WaitReadable, IO::WaitWritable
  Fiber.yield client
ensure
  client.close
end

reactor = Fiber.new do
  loop do
    r, w = IO.select(clients + [server], clients)
    if r.include? server
      sock = server.accept_nonblock
      clients << sock
      f = Fiber.new { handle(sock) }
      clients << f.resume
    end
    (r + w).each { |sock| Fiber.schedule(sock) }
  end
end

reactor.resume
