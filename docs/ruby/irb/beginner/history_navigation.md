## ðŸ”„ Navigating Command History

IRB saves your previous commands, letting you quickly recall them with the Up/Down arrow keys. You can also perform a reverse search by pressing `Ctrl + R` and typing part of a past command:

```ruby
(reverse-i-search)`puts': puts 'Hello, world!'
```

Press Enter to execute the found command or continue typing to refine your search.
