## 🛠️ Install and Initialize RSpec
Before writing tests, you need to add RSpec to your project. Add the gem to your Gemfile and run the installer to generate the spec directory and helper file.

```bash
gem install rspec
# or add to Gemfile:
gem 'rspec'
bundle install

# initialize RSpec in your project directory:
rspec --init
```
