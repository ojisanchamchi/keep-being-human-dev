## ðŸš€ Incremental Materialized View Refresh
Create materialized views for expensive aggregations and use `CONCURRENTLY` refresh for minimal locking impact.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
SELECT date_trunc('month', sale_date) AS month,
       SUM(amount) AS total
FROM sales
GROUP BY 1;

-- Initial populate
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales;

-- Concurrent refresh
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY monthly_sales;
```

For true incremental refresh, implement triggers on base tables writing deltas to a staging table and use `WITH NO DATA` plus selective `INSERT`/`UPDATE` on the matview.
