## ðŸš€ Leveraging Faker in High-Concurrency Performance and Load Testing

For realistic load testing or seeding, integrate Faker into multi-threaded or parallel workflows. Use a thread-safe pool (e.g., `concurrent-ruby`) and clear Fakerâ€™s unique generator per thread to avoid collisions and memory bloat. This approach scales data generation under stress tests.

```ruby
require 'concurrent'

# Define generator for a user record
def generate_user
  Faker::UniqueGenerator.clear  # Reset per-thread unique registry
  {
    email: Faker::Internet.unique.email,
    name:  Faker::Name.name,
    bio:   Faker::Quote.famous_last_words
  }
end

# Spawn a fixed thread pool for parallel seeding
pool = Concurrent::FixedThreadPool.new(10)
1000.times do
  pool.post do
    User.create!(generate_user)
  end
end
pool.shutdown
pool.wait_for_termination

# Verify count
puts "Seeded ", User.count, "users"
```
