## ðŸ”¢ Arithmetic Operators

Ruby supports the basic arithmetic operators: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), and `%` (modulus). Use them directly with numbers or numeric variables to perform calculations.

```ruby
a = 8 + 2     # 10
b = 10 - 3    # 7
c = 4 * 5     # 20
d = 20 / 4    # 5
e = 10 % 3    # 1 (remainder)
```
