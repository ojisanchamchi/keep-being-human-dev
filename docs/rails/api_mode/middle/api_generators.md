## ðŸ”§ Streamline Controllers with Rails API Generators
Use Rails' API mode generators to skip unnecessary middleware, views, and helpers. This keeps your controllers lightweight and focused on JSON responses. You can scaffold resources directly in API mode to speed up development.

```bash
# Create a new API-only Rails app
rails new my_api_app --api
# Generate an API scaffold for a Post resource
rails g scaffold Post title:string body:text --api
```
