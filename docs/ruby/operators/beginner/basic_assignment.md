## 📝 Basic Assignment

The `=` operator is used to assign values to variables in Ruby. It creates the variable if it doesn’t exist and stores the value on the right-hand side. You can reassign at any time to change what the variable holds.

```ruby
# Assigning an integer
count = 5

# Assigning a string
message = "Hello, world!"

# Reassigning later
count = 10
```
