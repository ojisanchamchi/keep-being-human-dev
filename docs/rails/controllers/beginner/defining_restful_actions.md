## ðŸš€ Defining RESTful Actions

Rails follows REST conventions: index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy. By adhering to these standard actions, you get predictable URLs and simpler routing. Ensure your routes file uses `resources` for automatic route generation.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :articles
end
```
