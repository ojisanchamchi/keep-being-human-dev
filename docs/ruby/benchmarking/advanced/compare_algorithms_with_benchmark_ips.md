## âš¡ Utilize `benchmark-ips` for Throughput Metrics

When your goal is to measure iterations per second rather than elapsed time, `benchmark-ips` gives a more stable view of throughput especially for fast operations. It automatically tunes the number of iterations to minimize noise and provides warmup and measurement phases by default.

```ruby
require 'benchmark/ips'

Benchmark.ips do |x|
  x.report('string concat')   { 'hello' + ' ' + 'world' }
  x.report('string interpolate') { "#{'hello'} #{'world'}" }
  x.compare!
end
```
