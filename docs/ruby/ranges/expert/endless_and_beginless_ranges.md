## ðŸ¤¯ Master Endless and Beginless Ranges
Ruby 2.6 introduced endless (`start..`) and beginless (`..end`) ranges, which can be used for elegant threshold checks, slicing endless collections, and lazy enumerations. Theyâ€™re especially powerful when combined with methods like `lazy`, `take_while`, or `drop_while`.

```ruby
# Beginless range to filter early entries
data = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
early = data.drop_while { |n| n < 15 }  # [15, 20, 25]

# Endless range to limit values
numbers = (1..)    # infinite Enumerator
first_ten = numbers.take(10)            # [1,2,3,â€¦,10]

# Usage in slicing
array = %w[a b c d e f]
slice = array[..3]  # ["a","b","c","d"]
slice2 = array[2..] # ["c","d","e","f"]
```
