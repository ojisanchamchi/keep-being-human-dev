## ðŸ”„ Dynamic Partial Resolution Based on State

Implement dynamic partial lookup to render different templates for an objectâ€™s state without conditionals. Build your path string at runtime and let Rails pick the right partial. This pattern scales elegantly as new states or types appear.

```erb
<%# in views/orders/index.html.erb %>
<% @orders.each do |order| %>
  <%= render "orders/status/#{order.status}", order: order %>
<% end %>
```

```erb
<%# in views/orders/status/shipped.html.erb %>
<div class="order shipped">Shipped on <%= order.shipped_at.to_date %></div>
```
