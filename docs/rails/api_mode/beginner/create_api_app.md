## ðŸš€ Create an API-only Rails Application

Rails comes with a built-in API mode that strips out view rendering and other middleware you donâ€™t need for JSON services. Itâ€™s a lightweight starting point for building your backend API.

```shell
# Generate a new Rails app in API-only mode
$ rails new my_api --api
# Change into your app directory
dd my_api
```
