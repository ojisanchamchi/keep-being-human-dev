## üõ†Ô∏è Installing SQLite3

Before you start writing SQL queries, you need to install SQLite3 on your system. On macOS you can use Homebrew, on Linux you can use your distro's package manager, and on Windows you can download the precompiled binaries.

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install sqlite3

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

# Windows: download from https://sqlite.org/download.html
```
