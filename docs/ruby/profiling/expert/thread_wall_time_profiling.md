## ðŸ§µ Profiling Thread & Fiber CPU Contention via ThreadWallTimePrinter

RubyProf supports THREAD_WALL_TIME mode to attribute time spent in threads and fibers, revealing contention or GILâ€‘induced waits. Use ThreadFlatPrinter for a concise table of hot methods across threads.

```ruby
require 'ruby-prof'

RubyProf.measure_mode = RubyProf::THREAD_WALL_TIME
result = RubyProf.profile do
  threads = 5.times.map do
    Thread.new { heavy_workload }  # CPUâ€‘bound tasks
  end
  threads.each(&:join)
end

printer = RubyProf::ThreadFlatPrinter.new(result)
printer.print(STDOUT, {})
```
