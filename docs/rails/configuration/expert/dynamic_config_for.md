## ðŸ”§ Leverage `config_for` and `config.x` for Dynamic Namespaced Configuration

Using `Rails.application.config_for` together with the `config.x` namespace lets you load and merge complex YAML configs per environment, locale, or tenant without polluting your initializers. You can deep symbolize and merge nested data structures to deliver typeâ€‘safe settings throughout your app.

In `config/payment.yml`:
```yaml
common:
  timeout: 30
  retries: 3
production:
  client_id: <%= ENV['PAYMENT_CLIENT_ID'] %>
  secret: <%= ENV['PAYMENT_SECRET'] %>
development:
  client_id: "dev_id"
  secret: "dev_secret"
```

In `config/application.rb`:
```ruby
module MyApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Load and merge common + environment settings, deep symbolize keys
    raw = config_for(:payment)
    config.x.payment = raw.deep_symbolize_keys
  end
end
```

Usage anywhere in your app:
```ruby
timeout = Rails.configuration.x.payment[:timeout]
client_id = Rails.configuration.x.payment[:client_id]
```
