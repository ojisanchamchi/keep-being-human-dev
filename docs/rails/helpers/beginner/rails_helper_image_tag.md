## 🖼️ Tip: Display images with `image_tag`
The `image_tag` helper generates the proper `<img>` HTML tag and automatically sets the asset path. You can pass options like size and alt text for accessibility.

```erb
<%= image_tag 'logo.png', alt: 'Company Logo', size: '100x100' %>
```

Use this helper to manage asset paths and attributes easily.
