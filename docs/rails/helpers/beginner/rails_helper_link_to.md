## ðŸ”— Tip: Use `link_to` for links
The `link_to` helper simplifies creating anchor tags in your views. It takes the link text and a path or URL, generating proper HTML and escaping content by default.

```erb
<%= link_to 'View Post', post_path(@post) %>
```

This helper ensures your links are safe and concise.
