## ğŸ”„ Implementing Retries with Exponential Backoff

HTTParty doesnâ€™t provide builtâ€‘in retry logic, but you can wrap requests to handle transient failures. Hereâ€™s how to add exponential backoff and retry on 5xx or network errors by extending `HTTParty::Request`.

```ruby
require 'httparty'

module HTTParty
  class Request
    alias_method :orig_perform, :perform

    def perform(&block)
      retries = 0
      begin
        orig_perform(&block)
      rescue Errno::ETIMEDOUT, Errno::ECONNREFUSED, Net::OpenTimeout, Net::ReadTimeout, SocketError, HTTParty::Error => e
        if retries < 3
          backoff = (2 ** retries) + rand
          sleep(backoff)
          retries += 1
          retry
        end
        raise e
      end
    end
  end
end

class ResilientClient
  include HTTParty
  base_uri 'https://unstable-api.example.com'

  def fetch_resources
    self.class.get('/resources')
  end
end

client = ResilientClient.new
puts client.fetch_resources.code # will retry up to 3 times on failure
```
