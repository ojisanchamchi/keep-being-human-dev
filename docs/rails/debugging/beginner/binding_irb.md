## ðŸ’¡ Use binding.irb for Interactive Sessions

Rails 6+ includes `binding.irb` out of the box as an alternative to `byebug`. When execution hits this call, an IRB session opens, letting you inspect and modify state interactively.

```ruby
def create
  @article = Article.new(article_params)
  binding.irb
  @article.save!
end
```
