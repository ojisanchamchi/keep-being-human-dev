## ðŸ“‹ Check Your Current Rails Version

Before making any changes, itâ€™s helpful to know which Rails version your app is using. You can check it from the command line or within your code.

```bash
# In your terminal
rails -v
# Example output: Rails 6.1.4
```

Alternatively, inside a Rails console or initializer you can use:

```ruby
# Rails console or application code
def current_rails_version
  Rails.version
end

puts current_rails_version # => "6.1.4"
```
