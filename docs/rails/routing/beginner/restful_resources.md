## ðŸ“¦ Use RESTful `resources` for CRUD routes

Defining a RESTful resource generates all seven standard CRUD routes (index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy) with a single line of code. This keeps your `config/routes.rb` concise and follows Rails conventions, making your routes predictable and easy to work with.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :articles
end
```

After this, you can use helper methods like `articles_path`, `new_article_path`, and `edit_article_path(@article)` throughout your controllers and views.
