## ðŸš€ Boost Performance with `inverse_of`

Declaring `inverse_of` helps Rails maintain in-memory object consistency and reduces unnecessary database queries. It lets associated objects know about each other without reloading, especially with bi-directional relations. This is invaluable when building or validating nested records.

```ruby
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :line_items, inverse_of: :order
end

class LineItem < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :order, inverse_of: :line_items
end

# Now changes to line_items are reflected in order.line_items without extra queries.
```
