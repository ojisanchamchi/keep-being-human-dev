## ü™ù Choosing `prepend` Over Traditional Mixins for Override Safety
Prepending modules ensures your overrides are applied before any other inclusion, avoiding conflicts in large inheritance chains. This is especially valuable when multiple gems or plugins mix into the same class.

```ruby
module SafeNotifier
  def notify(*args)
    super if valid_notification?(*args)
  end
end

class NotificationService
  prepend SafeNotifier
  def notify(user, msg)
    # send message
  end
end
```

Using `prepend` guarantees your safety check runs first, even if other modules also override `notify`.
