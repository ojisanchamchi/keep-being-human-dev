## üõ†Ô∏è Leveraging Plugin Generators for Quick Scaffolding

Plugins often ship with Rails generators to speed up setup. Use them to copy over migrations, assets, or config files.

```bash
# Copy migrations from the engine to your app
rails blog_engine:install:migrations

# Run the migrations
rails db:migrate

# Copy over sample locale files
rails plugin_name:install:locales
```

This approach ensures you get all necessary files into your project structure, allowing you to tweak them locally while retaining consistency with the plugin‚Äôs updates.
