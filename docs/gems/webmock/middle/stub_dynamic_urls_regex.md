## ðŸ•¸ Stub Dynamic URLs with Regex Patterns
When your application makes HTTP calls to URLs that include dynamic segmentsâ€”like user IDs or timestampsâ€”you can use regular expressions in WebMock to stub them without enumerating every possible URL. This approach keeps your stubs concise and maintainable. Simply pass a Ruby `Regexp` to `stub_request` to match any URL fitting the pattern.

```ruby
require 'webmock/rspec'

# Stub any GET request to /users/<number>/details
stub_request(:get, %r{https://api\.example\.com/users/\d+/details})
  .to_return(
    status: 200,
    body: '{"id":123,"name":"John Doe"}',
    headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' }
  )

# Example call
response = Net::HTTP.get(URI('https://api.example.com/users/456/details'))
puts response #=> {"id":123,"name":"John Doe"}
```
