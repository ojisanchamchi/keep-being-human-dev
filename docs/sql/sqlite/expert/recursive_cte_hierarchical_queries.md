## ðŸŒ€ Recursive Hierarchical Queries
Enable deep hierarchical querying using SQLite's recursive CTEs to navigate parentâ€‘child relationships efficiently. This approach avoids multiple round trips and leverages builtâ€‘in optimization for selfâ€‘referential data.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE hierarchy(employee_id, name, level) AS (
  SELECT id, name, 0
    FROM employees
   WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.id, e.name, h.level + 1
    FROM employees AS e
    JOIN hierarchy AS h ON e.manager_id = h.employee_id
)
SELECT *
  FROM hierarchy;
```
