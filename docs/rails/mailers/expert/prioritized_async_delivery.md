## ðŸš€ Prioritized Asynchronous Delivery

Leverage ActiveJobâ€™s queueing system to schedule emails with different priorities, backoff strategies, and retry limits. By assigning specific queues and priority levels, you can prevent lowâ€‘priority batch mails from blocking critical notifications.

```ruby
# app/mailers/notification_mailer.rb
class NotificationMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def urgent_notification(user)
    mail(to: user.email, subject: "Urgent Update")
  end
end

# Enqueue with high priority
NotificationMailer
  .urgent_notification(@user)
  .deliver_later(wait: 1.minute, queue: "critical", priority: 1)

# config/sidekiq.yml
:queues:
  - [critical, 10]
  - [default, 5]
  - [low_priority, 1]
```

This approach ensures urgent mails are processed first, while batch jobs fall back to `low_priority` without starving the system.
