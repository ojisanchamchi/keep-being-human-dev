## ↕️ Ordering Query Results

Sort your query results using `ORDER BY`. You can specify ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order on one or more columns.

```sql
-- Order by name ascending
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name ASC;

-- Order by id descending
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id DESC;
```
