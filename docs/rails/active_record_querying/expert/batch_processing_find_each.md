## ðŸ“ˆ Batch Processing Huge Result Sets
Avoid loading millions of records into memory by using `find_each` or `in_batches` with custom batch sizes and scopes. You can chain conditions to process only relevant subsets and even update records in place within each batch.

```ruby
Order.where(status: 'pending').in_batches(of: 1_000) do |batch|
  batch.update_all(processed: true)
  puts "Processed #{batch.size} orders"
end
``` 

Custom batch sizes and combining `select` with `pluck` for only the required columns further optimizes throughput and memory usage.
