## ðŸŽ¨ In-Memory Processing without Temp Files

Avoid writing intermediate files to disk by chaining operations in memory. You can use `Image.read` and `.to_blob` to pass data directly between commands, speeding up your pipeline and reducing I/O overhead.

```ruby
original = MiniMagick::Image.open("input.jpg")
# Chain operations and get a binary blob
blob = original.combine_options do |c|
  c.resize "800x600"
  c.rotate "90"
end.to_blob

# Read the modified blob back into MiniMagick
processed = MiniMagick::Image.read(blob)
processed.format "png"
processed.write "output.png"
```
