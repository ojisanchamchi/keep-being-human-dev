## ðŸ”¢ Use Character Classes and Shorthand
Character classes let you match sets of characters concisely. You can combine shorthand classes like `\d` (digits) and custom ranges like `[A-Fa-f]` to fine-tune your patterns.

```ruby
pattern = /[A-Za-z]\w{2,10}\d*/   # starts with a letter, 2â€“10 word chars, optional digits
'Hello123'.match?(pattern)          # => true
'1Hello'.match?(pattern)           # => false
```

Use `\s`, `\S`, `\w`, `\W`, `\d`, and `\D` to cover common classes without lengthy lists.
