## 📏 Checking Length and Emptiness

Use `.length` (or `.size`) to get the number of characters in a string, and `.empty?` to quickly test if it contains nothing. These are useful for validation or conditional logic.

```ruby
s1 = ""
s2 = "Hi"
puts s1.empty?    # => true
puts s2.length     # => 2
```
