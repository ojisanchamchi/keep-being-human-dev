## üõ°Ô∏è Securing Connections with Authorization

Ensure only authenticated users can open WebSocket connections by identifying them in `Connection` and rejecting unauthorized attempts. This guards your channels from unwanted access.

```ruby
# app/channels/application_cable/connection.rb
module ApplicationCable
  class Connection < ActionCable::Connection::Base
    identified_by :current_user

    def connect
      self.current_user = find_verified_user
    end

    private

    def find_verified_user
      if (user = User.find_by(id: cookies.signed[:user_id]))
        user
      else
        reject_unauthorized_connection
      end
    end
  end
end
```
