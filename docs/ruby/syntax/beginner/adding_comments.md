## 📝 Adding Comments
Comments help you document your code and explain non-obvious logic. Use `#` for single-line comments, and `=begin`/`=end` for multi-line comments only when necessary. They are ignored by the interpreter and keep your code readable.

```ruby
# This is a single-line comment
def add(a, b)
  a + b
end

=begin
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
=end
```
