## ðŸš€ Use Net::HTTP::Persistent for Connection Reuse

Net::HTTP::Persistent gem manages persistent HTTP connections to reduce handshake overhead and improve throughput. It transparently reuses connections across requests, handling thread safety and idle timeouts. This is ideal for high-frequency API interactions or microservice communication.

```ruby
require 'net/http/persistent'

uri = URI('https://api.example.com/data')
http = Net::HTTP::Persistent.new(name: 'my-client')
response1 = http.request(uri)
response2 = http.request(uri)  # reuses TCP connection
puts response2.body
```
