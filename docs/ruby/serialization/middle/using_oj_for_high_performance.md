## ðŸš€ Use Oj for Highâ€‘Performance JSON Serialization

Oj is a Câ€‘based JSON library optimized for speed and low memory. By configuring it as Railsâ€™ default encoder/decoder, youâ€™ll see big gains when rendering large or nested Ruby objects.

```ruby
# Add to Gemfile
gem 'oj'

# Then in config/initializers/oj.rb
require 'oj'
Oj.optimize_rails

# Now ActiveSupport JSON uses Oj under the hood
data = { users: User.all.as_json }
puts data.to_json
```
