## ü§ù Entity Composition with Concern Patterns
Rails‚Äô `ActiveSupport::Concern` simplifies module inclusion, dependency declaration, and shared logic. Use `included` and `ClassMethods` within concerns to compose features across models or controllers with minimal friction.

```ruby
module Taggable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    has_many :taggings
    has_many :tags, through: :taggings
  end

  def tag_list
    tags.map(&:name).join(', ')
  end
end

class Article < ApplicationRecord
  include Taggable
end
```

Concerns enforce order of inclusion and avoid common mixin pitfalls.
