## 📝 Tip: Build forms with `form_with`
The `form_with` helper generates form tags linked to a model or URL, streamlining form building and handling. It uses unobtrusive JavaScript by default and can submit via AJAX when `local` is false.

```erb
<%= form_with model: @post, local: true do |form| %>
  <%= form.label :title %>
  <%= form.text_field :title %>
  <%= form.submit 'Save' %>
<% end %>
```

Set `local: true` to disable remote AJAX submission for simplicity.
