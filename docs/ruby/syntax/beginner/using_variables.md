## ðŸ’¡ Using Variables
Variables in Ruby are loosely typed and donâ€™t require explicit declarations. You simply assign a value to a name and use it anywhere in scope. This helps you get started quickly with Ruby without boilerplate code.

```ruby
greeting = "Hello, world!"
count = 5
puts "#{greeting} Count is #{count}."
```
