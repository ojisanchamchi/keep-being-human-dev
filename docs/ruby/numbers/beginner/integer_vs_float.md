## ðŸ”¢ Distinguish Integers and Floats

Ruby has Integer and Float types for whole and decimal numbers. Use Integer for exact whole values and Float for numbers with fractional parts. You can check the class of a number with the `.class` method.

```ruby
age = 30        # Integer
price = 19.99   # Float

puts age.class    # => Integer
puts price.class  # => Float
```
