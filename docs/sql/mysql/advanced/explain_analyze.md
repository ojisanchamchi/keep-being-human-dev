## 🔍 Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for Accurate Costing
Running EXPLAIN ANALYZE executes the query and returns real execution metrics, including actual row counts and timing. This helps identify costly operations and misestimated cardinalities that a simple EXPLAIN may miss. Use these insights to adjust indexes, rewrite joins, or refactor subqueries.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM orders
WHERE created_at > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY user_id;
```
