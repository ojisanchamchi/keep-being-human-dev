## ðŸ§© Organize Code with Modules as Namespaces and Mixins
Modules in Ruby can serve both as namespaces to prevent constant collisions and as mixins to share behavior across classes. By structuring your modules hierarchically, you can keep your codebase tidy and avoid polluting the global scope.

Example of using modules as namespaces:

```ruby
module PaymentGateway
  module Stripe
    class Client
      def charge(amount)
        # implementation
      end
    end
  end
end

# Usage
target = PaymentGateway::Stripe::Client.new
``` 

Mixin behavior across classes:

```ruby
module Trackable
  def track(event)
    puts "Tracking [32m[0m#{event}"  # colorized output
  end
end

class Order
  include Trackable
end

order = Order.new
order.track('order_created')
```
