## ðŸ“¦ Precompile Assets for Faster Loads
In production, serve precompiled CSS and JS to avoid on-the-fly compilation. Precompiling reduces request time and eliminates runtime asset compilation overhead.

```bash
# Precompile assets locally
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails assets:precompile

# Deploy and serve from public/assets
# Ensure your web server is configured to serve static files
```
