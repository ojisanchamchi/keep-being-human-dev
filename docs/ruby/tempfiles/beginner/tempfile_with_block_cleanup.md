## ðŸ’¡ Use Block Form for Auto Cleanup
Using Tempfile in block form ensures itâ€™s closed and unlinked automatically when the block exits. This pattern prevents resource leaks and is perfect for shortâ€‘lived tasks without manual cleanup.

```ruby
require 'tempfile'

Tempfile.create(['demo', '.txt']) do |file|
  file.write("Block form handles cleanup!\n")
  file.rewind
  puts file.read  # => "Block form handles cleanup!\n"
end

# At this point, the tempfile is closed and deleted automatically.
```
