## ðŸ“¦ Define a Basic Class

Every Ruby class starts with the `class` keyword and a name in CamelCase, encapsulating behavior and data for objects. You can keep the class body empty or add methods and attributes as you go. This is the foundation of object-oriented programming in Ruby.

```ruby
class Person
  # methods and attributes go here
end
```
