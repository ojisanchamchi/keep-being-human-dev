## ðŸ“¦ Modularize Code with `ActiveSupport::Concern`
`ActiveSupport::Concern` streamlines shared module creation by handling `included` blocks and dependency declarations. This keeps your models/controllers DRY and organized.

```ruby
module Trackable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    before_save :track_changes
  end

  def track_changes
    # custom tracking logic here
  end
end

class User < ApplicationRecord
  include Trackable
end
```
