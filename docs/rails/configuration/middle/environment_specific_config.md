## üåê Environment‚ÄëSpecific Error Reporting and Caching

Fine‚Äëtune Rails behavior per environment by editing `config/environments/*.rb`. For example, you might disable full error reports in staging but keep caching off to aid debugging:

```ruby
# config/environments/staging.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # Treat staging like production for error pages
  config.consider_all_requests_local = false
  config.action_dispatch.show_exceptions = true

  # Enable caching to test performance
  config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
  config.cache_store = :memory_store
end
```

Meanwhile, in development you typically have:

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
Rails.application.configure do
  config.consider_all_requests_local = true
  config.action_controller.perform_caching = false
end
```

This approach ensures each environment behaves appropriately without extra conditional logic scattered across the codebase.
