## ğŸ”¢ Exact Arithmetic with Rational Matrices

Floatingâ€‘point rounding can introduce subtle bugs in determinants and inverses. By using Rational entries, Rubyâ€™s Matrix performs exact arithmetic, ensuring precise results. This is invaluable when symbolic correctness is required.

```ruby
require 'matrix'

# Construct a matrix with Rational entries
ea = Matrix[
  [Rational(1, 3), Rational(2, 5)],
  [Rational(3, 7), Rational(4, 9)]
]

# Compute exact determinant and inverse
det = ea.determinant  # => Rational exact value
inv = ea.inverse       # => Matrix of Rationals

puts "Determinant: #{det}"
puts "Inverse:\n#{inv}"
