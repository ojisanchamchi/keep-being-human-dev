## ðŸ“‚ Declarative Range Partitioning for Large Tables
Partition large fact tables by range (e.g., date or numeric ranges) to improve query performance and management. PostgreSQLâ€™s declarative partitioning automatically routes inserts to the correct partition and prunes irrelevant partitions at query time. Create child tables with check constraints for each range.

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  event_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  payload JSONB
) PARTITION BY RANGE (event_time);

CREATE TABLE events_2023_q1 PARTITION OF events
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2023-04-01');

CREATE TABLE events_2023_q2 PARTITION OF events
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-04-01') TO ('2023-07-01');
```
