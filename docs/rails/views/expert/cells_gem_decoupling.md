## ðŸ§© Decouple View Logic Using Trailblazer Cells
Isolate view rendering and business logic in Trailblazer Cells to adhere to Single Responsibility. Cells give you complete encapsulation and dedicated test boundaries for UI components.

```ruby
# app/cells/user_cell.rb
class UserCell < Cell::ViewModel
  property :name, :email

  def show
    render
  end
end
```

Usage in a view:

```erb
<%= cell(:user, @user).show %>
```
