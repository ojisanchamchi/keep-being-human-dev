## ðŸ“ˆ Implement Event Sourcing with Redis Streams
Redis Streams provide an appendâ€‘only log ideal for event sourcing, offering instant fanâ€‘out and consumer groups for guaranteed, scalable processing. By modeling state changes as discrete events, you can rebuild application state at any point and handle backâ€‘pressure gracefully. Use `XADD` to log events, `XREADGROUP` for consumers, and `XACK` to mark successes.

```ruby
# publisher.rb
event = {id: SecureRandom.uuid, type: 'OrderCreated', payload: {order_id: 42, total: 99.99}}
$redis.xadd('orders:stream', '*', event)

# consumer.rb
group = 'order_processors'
stream = 'orders:stream'
begin
  $redis.xgroup('CREATE', stream, group, '$', mkstream: true)
rescue Redis::CommandError; end

loop do
  entries = $redis.xreadgroup(group, 'consumer-1', {stream => '>'}, count: 10, block: 5_000)
  next unless entries

  entries.each do |_, msgs|
    msgs.each do |id, data|
      process_order(data)
      $redis.xack(stream, group, id)
    end
  end
end
```
