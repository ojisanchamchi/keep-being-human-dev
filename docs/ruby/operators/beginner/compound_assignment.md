## âž• Compound Assignment Operators

Ruby lets you combine an operation and assignment in one step using operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=`. This makes your code shorter and more expressive when updating numeric variables.

```ruby
score = 10
score += 5   # score is now 15
score -= 3   # score is now 12
score *= 2   # score is now 24
```
