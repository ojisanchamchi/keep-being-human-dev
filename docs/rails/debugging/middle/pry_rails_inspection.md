## üîç Leverage Pry-Rails for In-Depth Object Inspection

Pry-Rails replaces the standard Rails console with Pry, providing syntax highlighting, command history, and powerful introspection commands. Use `binding.pry` to jump into a context where you can explore object methods, change variables, or even redefine methods before continuing execution.

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'pry-rails'
gem 'pry-byebug'

# app/models/order.rb
class Order < ApplicationRecord
  def total_price
    binding.pry  # Pause here and inspect `self`
    line_items.sum(&:price)
  end
end
```

In the console prompt, type `ls` to list methods/variables or `show-source Order` to view class source.
