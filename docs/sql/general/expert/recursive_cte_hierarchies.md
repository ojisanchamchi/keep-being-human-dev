## üîÅ Recursive CTE for Hierarchical Data
Leverage recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to traverse tree-like hierarchies in a single query. This approach avoids multiple round-trips and scales with data depth dynamically.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_tree AS (
  SELECT id, parent_id, name, 1 AS level
  FROM organization
  WHERE parent_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT o.id, o.parent_id, o.name, t.level + 1
  FROM organization o
  JOIN org_tree t ON o.parent_id = t.id
)
SELECT *
FROM org_tree
ORDER BY level, parent_id;
```

This returns the entire organizational chart with levels. Add `PATH` concatenation in the CTE for full lineage strings.
